# ReactJS Interview Test - User Dashboard

Welcome to the ReactJS interview test for building a User Dashboard! This test is designed to evaluate your proficiency in ReactJS and your ability to create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with additional features. Please follow the instructions below to complete the test.

## Requirements

### 1. Set Up the Project

- Clone this project to your computer using Git or download the source code.
- Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder.

### 2. Mock API (Optional)

- If you prefer to use a mock API, you can create a TypeScript file to simulate API calls and data. The TypeScript file should export functions for CRUD operations (e.g., getUsers, addUser, editUser, deleteUser).
- If you choose not to use a mock API, you can create a server using any programming language of your choice to serve as your API.

### 3. Create a User Dashboard

- Implement a User Dashboard page that displays a list of users.
- Include a sidebar navigation menu with options to view the user list, add a new user, and edit user details.
- Implement a CRUD functionality for users:
  - **Create**: Allow users to add new users through a modal.
  - **Read**: Display a paginated list of users with options to view user details and edit user information through modals.
  - **Update**: Allow users to edit user details through a modal.
  - **Delete**: Allow users to delete users.

### 4. Pagination

- Implement pagination to display a limited number of users per page.
- Provide options to navigate between pages.

### 5. Modals

- Create modals for adding new users and editing user details.
- Use modals to display user information and allow for editing.
- Ensure proper validation and error handling in modals.

### 6. Evaluation

- Your evaluation will be based on how well you structure your React components, manage state, and handle user interactions.
- You should also demonstrate your ability to make API calls (or mock API calls) and handle data.
- Code quality, readability, and adherence to best practices will be considered during the assessment.

### 7. Submission

- After completing the test, please create a pull request (PR) to this project on GitHub and send the PR link to your interviewer.

## Notes

- This project provides a basic structure for your React application, but you are encouraged to organize your code as needed.
- You can use any additional libraries or frameworks if you believe they will help you accomplish the task more efficiently.
- Feel free to be creative in your implementation, and make sure to thoroughly test your application.

Good luck, and have fun building your User Dashboard in ReactJS!
